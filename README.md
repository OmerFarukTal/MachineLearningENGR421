# MachineLearningENGR421

ENGR 421 Projects that are designed to implement different Machine Learning methods. 
The projects task will be added if found. These projects are assignment driven, so they are not generalizable. 
Any machine learning shortcut methods is not used 
since the main aim of the projects is to examine the underlying structure of the common Machine Learning Algorithms.
